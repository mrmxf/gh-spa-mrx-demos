#### Concept

**Signiant Jet** can be triggered to capture live events by connecting to an
Arqiva **Live Picture Exchage** Directory ([LPX]). An event is selected and an
automatic ETL (**E**xtract, **T**ransform & **L**oad) from **MetaRex** provides
native metadata to Jet:

* show descriptive & QC text in the Jet UI for display
* synthesize a live graphic / icon
* import event metadata into Snowflake
* embed the metadata into the essence for downstream propagation
* Metarex hosted web services:  Validates documents, check QC status, synthesize icons etc.

QC rejection while leveraging the latest work on QC flows from the
IMG User Group.!

1. create definitions for the reports from the QC vendors

3. Detect and apply manual overrides to multi-stage QC workflows
4. Automagically create pictorial dashboards`,

**MetaRex** _fixes the network_: A single common container for putting any
metadata on or off any network. _Less setup time_.

**MetaRex** _fixes the data types_: Every data format describes itself.
Simple Web Services **Extract** **Load** & **Transform** data for each data
type.

**MetaRex** _is secure_: The register for discovering data types is
hierarchical. No data leaves the building unless you allow it.

**MetaRex** _helps ETL_: When data describes itself. Creating an automatic ETL
for simple use cases can be done without code.`,

A bitstream analyser quickly parses a slice of the MXF file and creates a
simple JSON giving us the average bits/frame of each echelon.
